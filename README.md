# DockerizedSpringApp
Spring app with very simple GUI, reverse proxies and database in docker.
The app has both file endpoints as well as endpoints for some entities.
The GUI is for files only, so in order to use other endpoints one would need a tool like postman.
One file in GUI was created by another person.
